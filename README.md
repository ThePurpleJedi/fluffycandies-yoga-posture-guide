# FluffyCandies Yoga Posture Guidance

An ML-Powered Yoga Posture Guide

## Introduction

This app is intended to help individuals practice yogasanas from the comfort of their homes, while receiving visual feedback about their performance and measures for tracking their improvement.
We implement a real-time feedback mechanism and a means to correct the user’s posture when a yoga pose is performed, keeping in mind the user’s convenience. Our solution requires only a functional 
Android mobile device, which makes it available for a wide variety of users. We have implemented features such as voice search and a countdown timer, and used a database compiled from both online 
sources as well as data gathered on campus as well.
